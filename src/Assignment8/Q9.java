    //The main difference between the first level and second level cache in Hibernate is that the first level is maintained at the Session level and accessible only to the Session, while the second level cache is maintained at the SessionFactory level and available to all Sessions.
    // This means, you can use the first-level cache to store local data, i.e. the data which is needed by the Session, and you can use the second-level cache to store global data, i.e. something which can be shared across sessions.
