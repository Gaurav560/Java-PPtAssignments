    //Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is same as SQL (Structured Query Language) but it doesn't depends on the table of the database.
    // Instead of table name, we use class name in HQL.
    // So it is database independent query language.


    //Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent objects and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turns perform action on database.
    //
    //Although you can use SQL statements directly with Hibernate using Native SQL, but I would recommend to use HQL whenever possible to avoid database portability hassles, and to take advantage of Hibernate's SQL generation and caching strategies.
    //
    //Keywords like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE, etc., are not case sensitive, but properties like table and column names are case sensitive in HQL

    //There are many advantages of HQL. They are as follows:

    //database independent
    //supports polymorphic queries
    //easy to learn for Java Programmer
}
