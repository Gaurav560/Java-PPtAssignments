    //SessionFactory is an interface. SessionFactory can be created by providing Configuration object, which will contain all DB related property details pulled from either hibernate.cfg.xml file or hibernate.properties file. SessionFactory is a factory for Session objects.

    //We can create one SessionFactory implementation per database in any application. If your application is referring to multiple databases, then you need to create one SessionFactory per database.
    //
    //The SessionFactory is a heavyweight object; it is usually created during application start up and kept for later use. The SessionFactory is a thread safe object and used by all the threads of an application.
