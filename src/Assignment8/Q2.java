    //Hibernate eliminates a lot of boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC API, the code looks cleaner and readable.
    //This Java framework supports inheritance, associations, and collections. These features are actually not present in JDBC.
    //HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is more object-oriented and close to Java. But for JDBC, you need to write native SQL queries.
    //Hibernate implicitly provides transaction management whereas, in JDBC API, you need to write code for transaction management using commit and rollback.
    //JDBC throws SQLException that is a checked exception, so you have to write a lot of try-catch block code. Hibernate wraps JDBC exceptions and throw JDBCException or
    // HibernateException which are the unchecked exceptions, so you donâ€™t have to write code to handle it has built-in transaction management which helps in removing the usage of try-catch blocks.
