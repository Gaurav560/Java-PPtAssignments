    //SOAP supports only XML data exchange.
    // REST supports XML, JSON, plain text, HTML. SOAP messages are larger, which makes communication slower.
    // REST has faster performance due to smaller messages and caching support.

    //SOAP is a protocol.
    // REST is an architectural approach.


    //SOAP acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol.
    // REST acronym for REpresentational State Transfer.



    //In SOAP, the data exchange format is always XML.
    // There is no strict data exchange format. We can use JSON, XML, etc.


    //XML is the most popular data exchange format in SOAP web services.
    // JSON is the most popular data exchange format in RESTful web services.


    //SOAP uses Web Service Definition Language (WSDL).
    // REST does not have any standard definition language.


    //SOAP does not pose any restrictions on transport.
    // We can use either HTTP or MQ.
    // RESTful services use the most popular HTTP protocol.


    //SOAP web services are typical to implement.
    // RESTful services are easier to implement than SOAP.


    //SOAP web services use the JAX-WS API.
    // RESTful web services use the JAX-RS API.


    //SOAP protocol defines too many standards.
    // RESTful services do not emphasis on too many standards.


    //SOAP cannot use RESTful services because it is a protocol.
    // RESTful service can use SOAP web services because it is an architectural approach that can use any protocol like HTTP and SOAP.




    //SOAP reads cannot be cached.
    // REST reads can be cached.
