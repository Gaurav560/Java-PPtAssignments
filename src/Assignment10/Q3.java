    //DispatcherServlet handles an incoming HttpRequest, delegates the request,
    // and processes that request according to the configured HandlerAdapter interfaces that have been implemented within the Spring application along with accompanying annotations specifying handlers, controller endpoints, and response objects


    //spring mvc architecture

    //A Spring MVC provides an elegant solution to use MVC in spring framework by the help of DispatcherServlet.
    // Here, DispatcherServlet is a class that receives the incoming request and maps it to the right resource such as controllers, models, and views.

    //Model - A model contains the data of the application. A data can be a single object or a collection of objects.
    //Controller - A controller contains the business logic of an application. Here, the @Controller annotation is used to mark the class as the controller.
    //View - A view represents the provided information in a particular format. Generally, JSP+JSTL is used to create a view page. Although spring also supports other view technologies such as Apache Velocity, Thymeleaf and FreeMarker.
    //Front Controller - In Spring Web MVC, the DispatcherServlet class works as the front controller. It is responsible to manage the flow of the Spring MVC application.
