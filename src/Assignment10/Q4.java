//Spring MVC is a Web MVC Framework for building web applications.
// In generic all MVC frameworks provide a way of working with views.
// Spring does that via the ViewResolvers,
// which enables you to render models in the browser without tying the implementation to specific view technology.


    //View Resolver pattern is a J2EE pattern that enables a web application to dynamically select its view technology.
    // For example, HTML, JSP, Tapestry, JSF, XSLT etc. In this pattern, View resolver holds mapping of different views, controller return name of the view, which is then delegated to the View Resolver for selecting an appropriate view.
    // Spring MVC framework supplies inbuilt view resolver for selecting views.
