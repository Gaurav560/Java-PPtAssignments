    //@ModelAttribute is an annotation that binds a method parameter or method return value to a named model attribute, and then exposes it to a web view

    //@ModelAttribute Annotation refers to a property of the Model object (the M in MVC ;). @ModelAttribute is a Spring-MVC specific annotation used for preparing the model data.
    // It is also used to define the command object that would be bound with the HTTP request data. The annotation works only if the class is a Controller class (i.e. annotated with @Controller).
    //This @ModelAttribute Annotation can be applied on both methods as well as method-parameters. It accepts an optional “value”, which indicates the name of the attribute.
    // If no value is supplied to the annotation, then the value would be defaulted to the return type name in case of methods and parameter type name in case of method-parameters.
