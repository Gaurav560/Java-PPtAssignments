    //@RequestParam and @PathVariable can both be used to extract values from the request URI, but they are a bit different.
//In Spring MVC, the @RequestParam annotation is used to bind a request parameter to a method parameter. It is typically used to extract query parameters or form data from an HTTP request.
//
//On the other hand, the @PathVariable annotation is used to bind a URI template variable to a method parameter.
// It is typically used to extract values from the path portion of a URI, such as the value of an ID in a RESTful API.
