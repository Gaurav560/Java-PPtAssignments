    //In Spring MVC, the model works a container that contains the data of the application.
    // Here, a data can be in any form such as objects, strings, information from the database, etc. It is required to place the Model interface in the controller part of the application.
//In the MVC framework, M stands for Model – used to work with the data, V stands for View – used to work with presenting data to user and C stands for Controller – that contains actual business logic to process the user input.
//
//Spring Framework provides an Interface called Model(I) to work with the data. It defines a placeholder for model attributes and is primarily designed for adding attributes to the model.
// It is also used to transfer data between the view and controller of the Spring MVC application.
// Model interface is available in the org.springframework.ui package. It acts as a data container that contains the data of the application. That stored data can be of any form such as String, Object, data from the Database, etc.
