    //Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work.
    // REST was initially created as a guideline to manage communication on a complex network like the internet
//An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications or devices can connect to and communicate with each other.
// A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style
// . For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred to RESTful APIs.
