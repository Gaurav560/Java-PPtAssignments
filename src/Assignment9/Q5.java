    //Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code so that it can be easy to manage and test the application.
    // Dependency Injection makes our programming code loosely coupled.
    //Spring framework provides two ways to inject dependency
    //
    //By Constructor
    //By Setter method
